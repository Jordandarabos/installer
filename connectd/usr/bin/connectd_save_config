# connectd_config_save - use to call a platform specific command to save registration
# configuration data to persistent storage, if needed.
# Author: Gary Worsham - gary@remote.it
# Purpose of this file:
# The 4 folders /etc/connectd/dfiles, /etc/connectd/pfiles, /etc/connectd/available, and /etc/connectd/active
# along with all the files contained therein must all be saved in persistent storage.  
# If they are not automatically saved to a persistent storage area, this file
# must be modified to include platform specific commands to perform that backup.
# This function does not retrieve files from persistent storage to the working folders above on a boot.
# Providing a function to copy the 4 folder and files/links from persistent storage to the working folders at 
# boot time is the responsibility of the OEM.
# Users of devices with fully persistent operating systems such as Raspberry Pi (SD Card) or Ubuntu (hard drive)
# should not have to change this file.
